# FRC_AI

Version 2 of my attempt to create a simulation environment for training a neural network driven FRC robot.

# Setup

If you wish to use this without incident you will need to create an anaconda environment with the same packages.

1. The exported conda environment is located in the project root titled
`FRC_AI.yml`
2. You can then generate a new environment by running 
```shell script
conda env create -f=FRC_AI.yml
```
